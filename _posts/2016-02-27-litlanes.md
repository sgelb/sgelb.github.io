Demonstration of various algorithms for procedural generation of spatial
infinite landscapes. <!--more--> Focuses on showing the basic differences of Perlin
Noise/fBm, Ridged-Multifractal Noise, Billow Noise and Random Noise and how
factors like frequency or lacunarity influence the outcome.

### Dependencies

- C++11-compatible compiler
- Cmake
- OpenGL 3.3-compatible graphics card
- Runs on Linux. Should run on Windows, but its untested

### Build and run instructions

Build with `cd build && cmake .. && make`. Binaries and shaders are copied to `$PROJECTFOLDER/bin`

### Todo

- resizable window
- better handling of algorithm options
- show wireframe in solid color
- remove code repetition in buffer setup
- add option for number and size of rendered tiles
- implement level of detail using Quadtrees (see Ulrich paper)
- basic textures/color models
- basic implementation of rivers
- skybox / fog
- basic animation of sea
