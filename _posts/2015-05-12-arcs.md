Photograph each face of your rubik cube, let the app automatically detect the
colors and then follow the instructions to solve it.

### Features

- Automatic detection or manual input of face colors
- Animated illustrations and instructions for solving step by step


### Usage

1. Find the right face as indicated and align the grid
2. Press the *Camera* button. In most cases, all colors are detected correctly. You can also tap on each piece and set the color by hand
3. If all colors are correct, press the *Next* Button
4. After the 6th face, press the *Solve* button.
5. Rotate the cube with the orange center facing you and the yellow center piece
on the upper side
6. Now follow the instructions step by step and solve the cube.


### Notes

This is a fully working but (obviously) unpolished university project of my
fellow student Sarchibald and me. Our main focus was on the use of
[OpenCV](http://www.opencv.org) in an Android app. The code for solving the cube was
written by [cs0x7f](https://github.com/cs0x7f/min2phase) and is based on
[Kociemba's Two-Phase algorithm](http://kociemba.org/cube.htm).
