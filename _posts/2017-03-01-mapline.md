Create a collection of accurate maps in print quality along your gpx or kml
track, in your scale, your format and the infos you need. You want a map in
1:85.000 on A5 paper along that winding river? Additional markers for camping
sites and supermarkets? No problem.

[Give it a try on the demo page!](https://sgelb.github.io/mapline/)

{% include image.html url="mapline_screenshot.jpg" description="A typical page
showing the track, distance markers and the overlaps of previous and next map
pages as well as some overall stats. Here, an example waypoint and markers for
drinking water and picnic sites are added as well. (Highly reduced image
quality)" %}



### Features

- Accurate scale throughout the whole route
- Printable quality of 300dpi
- Customizable paper format up to A2, page margins, distance markers and route color
- Support of waypoints
- Add additional points of interest, e.g. for drinking water or camp sites
- English and German language support


### Waypoints and POIs

Waypoints contained in the GPX can set a symbol name through the optional
[`sym`](https://www.rigacci.org/wiki/doku.php/tecnica/gps_cartografia_gis/gpx)
field. You can set the used icon by specify any [Maki
icon](https://www.mapbox.com/maki-icons/) by using their basename e.g.
_campsite-11_ in this field.

Additional POIs can be downloaded via
[Overpass](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Overpass_API). To add more
choices, see
[overpass.js](https://github.com/sgelb/mapline/blob/master/src/overpass.js).
POIs are downloaded for print areas only. In case of format or scale changes,
manually refresh by toggling the checkboxes.


### Development

Logic and PDF generation of `mapline` are performed client-side. Main external
libraries are [Mapbox GL JS](https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/) for map
creation and [jsPDF](https://github.com/MrRio/jsPDF) for PDF generation.

Before you can use `mapline`, you have to get your own [Mapbox access
token](https://www.mapbox.com/help/create-api-access-token/). Save it in
`src/mapboxtoken.js`:

    export default '<your access token here>';

- `yarn run install` should install all dependencies
- `yarn run serve` to start a dev server
- `yarn run build` generates a production build in `/dist`


### Prebuilds

Since v0.16.0, a bundled version is published for tagged commits in
`prebuild/`. See
[prebuild/README.md](https://github.com/sgelb/mapline/blob/master/prebuild/README.md)
for more infos on how to use it.

Prebuilds are generated using git hooks, see
[git-hooks/README.md](https://github.com/sgelb/mapline/blob/master/git-hooks/README.md)
for details.


### Limitations

An application written in Javascript, using WebGL and running entirely in the
browser has of course some limitations.

- [canvas size](https://webglstats.com/webgl/parameter/MAX_RENDERBUFFER_SIZE)
  and hence the maximum page format depend on your graphics card
- Javascript engines have a hardcoded maximum string size. This limits the size
  of the output PDF to
  [~268.44MB](https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/7210#issuecomment-160994222)

### Missing features and nice-to-haves

- a map style better suited for cycle tours and printing in black&white
- possibility to add points of views like drinking water or camping places
- a scale bar on the printouts
- elevation stats and marking of steep slopes
- support for multiple tracks

### Want to participate?

Although development is really slow, this is not a dead project. Pull-requests
are always welcome!
