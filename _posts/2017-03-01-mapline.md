Create a collection of accurate maps in print quality along your gpx track, in
your scale, your format and the infos you need.

[Demo page&#8599;](/demo/mapline/)

### Features
- Accurate scale throughout the whole route
- Printable quality of 300dpi
- Customizable paper format up to A2, page margins and distance markers

bike tour of mine. It shows the track, distance markers, overlaps of previous and next map pages
and some statistics. Quality of this example is highly reduced." %}

On a long tour, on foot or by bike, a map is pretty important. But electronic
devices need power and can break and printed maps are often in the wrong scale,
cover too much or not enough of an area or are just in a style unusable for
your purpose.

Inspired by the [bikeline Cycling
guides](http://www.esterbauer.com/international.html) and
[Openstreetmap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/about), this application uses
[Mapbox GL JS](https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/api/) to create the maps I
need. Vector tiles enable rendering in 300dpi, high enough for printing. There
are different styles available. Paper format, page margins and distance markers
are customizable. You want a map in 1:85.000 on A5 paper along that winding
river? No problem.

### Limitations

An application written in Javascript, using WebGL and running entirely in the
browser has of course some limitations.
- [canvas size](https://webglstats.com/webgl/parameter/MAX_RENDERBUFFER_SIZE) and hence the maximum page format depend on your graphics card
- Javascript engines have a hardcoded maximum string size. This limits the size of the output PDF to [~268.44MB](https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/7210#issuecomment-160994222), ~100 pages of A5 format

### Missing features and nice-to-haves

Before this javascript implementation using vector tiles, I wrote a Python programm which rendered the maps from a local PostGIS database. It took ages, it had some features which are still missing in `Mapline`. This is what I want to implement in the future:
- a map style better suited for cycle tours and printing in black&white
- possibility to show points of views like drinking water or camping places
- a scale bar
- elevation stats and marking of steep slopes
- support for additional gpx features besides tracks and routes
